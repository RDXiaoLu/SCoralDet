The Dataset collected and annotated 646 coral photos from the Coral Germplasm Conservation and Breeding Center at Hainan Tropical Ocean University in Sanya, China. The coral images were semi-automatically labeled using the SAM model \cite{kirillov2023} and Label Studio 1.7.3, and formatted into the COCO format as the Soft-Coral dataset. The dataset comprises images from six coral species: \textit{Euphylliaancora}, \textit{Favosites}, \textit{Platygyra}, \textit{Sarcophyton}, \textit{Sinularia}, and \textit{Wavinghand}.
